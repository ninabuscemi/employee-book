## Usage

1. Use the MySQL NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

    npm install

2. Use InquirerJs NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

    npm install mysql inquirer

3. Use console.table to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of console.table, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

    npm install console.table --save
